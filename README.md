# odin-recipes
This site was created as an exercise from The Odin Project. Instructions are found at https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes.
It's an extremely simple site demonstrating usage of HTML and Git. CSS was used to change the site's theming to night mode, but otherwise neglected.
